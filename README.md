# giphyme.io
I am Mario, an aspiring Software Engineer, pursuing Computer Science skills at QuickStart powered by Ed2go academy.
As part of my skill development, we were to test our skills with Javascript, Html and CSS by building a website with a search Engine.


# Project Description
This web/app is a product of user request to see a website that can provide trending and searchable gifs, that are available for computer and small devices 320px or below. This app can be accessed by visitors and registered users as well. All the search results are limited to 30 gifs per search.


# How to use it?
## Accessing the link
First all, you can start by access the website through this link: https://mrm-codes.github.io/giphyme.io/


## Exploring the Navigation  Menu
On top of your page you'll find the navigation menu in a black background. It contains Logo on the right and Home, About and Login links on the left.
### Logo and Home
The Logo and Home have the same function, which is to take you back to the initial page, regardless which part of the page you're exploring.
### About
The About page contains information about the website, such as mission, vision, team and more.
### Sign up or Login in
The sign up or login link is a button that provides you a form to create or access your account in case you want to become or already are a member.
Both forms require you to input your email and password, and the login form is the only form that can grant you access to your account.


## Exploring Gifs
You can start exploring gifs on the "trending gifs‚Äù section. To see more trending gifs, you can scroll up or down. Click on the gif that you like to see it in higher resolution. When opened you can easily find the close button on the top left corner of the gif and click it to close and keep exploring.


### Using a search bar
To look for a gif by name or category, you can go to the search bar and type what kind of gif you want. In case of type error you can use your backspace/delete button on your keyboard or remove everything by using the clear button on the center left side of the input field.


### Submitting a request
To submit your search request, you can click on the search button and voila! and your results will be there. scroll up and down to see more from your results and click on the gif to see it in higher resolution.


# Technologies used
In the plane phase, technologies like draw.io were one of important tools the build wireframes of the application;
The internet and browsers like google, to research and troubleshoot code functionality and gain insights to improve code quality.
To build the application, we used Visual Studio Code to work on HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.
As for the content resource, we used giphy.com API.


# Ideas for the future
For the future for each gif, we intend to add more action to the app such as like, share, add to favorite.
add  more sections and category on the navigation menu
add stickers and clips sections
